Here is the link to test my individual assignment URL:https://coleboel.github.io/csc642-848-fall2021-individualassignment-joshuaboelman.github.io/

For the development I used Bootstrap 5.

For field validation I used the constraint validation API supported by basically all modern browsers. Instead of creating custom feedback styles I found the default feedback messages for each respective form value worked perfectly and fit the color scheme of my form. Bootstrap automatically scopes the styles to the parent .was-validated class so  I simply applied them to the form.

For maps I used The Maps Embed API, a free API distributed by google that allows you to input your location information and displays it as a pin on a map. It was very easy to use.

For captcha I was initially going to create it, if you go back in my git commits you can see, but I ended up using a free CSS template from codePen. All I had to do was apply a little bit of additional styling and toss the javascript code into my index.js and it was ready to go.

For the testing, I did not add any testing bots.

For this work I was helped by google.

Documentation and Code I developed for this assignment are in https://github.com/ColeBoel/csc642-848-fall2021-individualassignment-joshuaboelman.github.io
